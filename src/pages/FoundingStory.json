The Founding Story of ARBIEM

Arbiem was founded by Rafi Barides, a Singer Songwriter and software engineer, to address a gap in the modern music ecosystem.

As an independent artist, Barides observed that many expressive tools essential to building an artist’s narrative, such as motion artwork, advanced synced lyrics with background vocals, and animated profile visuals, were reserved for artists signed to major labels. These features, while framed as premium, play a critical role in storytelling and audience connection, yet remain inaccessible to most independent musicians.

ARBIEM was created as a response to that imbalance. The platforms mission is to empower artists by giving them access to the same creative and technical features traditionally gatekept by the industry, allowing them to fully present their work and identity on their own terms.

For listeners, ARBIEM offers a way to discover and support local and emerging talent early, listen without ads, and re-engage with music as a community-driven experience rather than a purely algorithmic one.

Rafi Barides, who has released multiple projects including Rags to Rags and Storm Before the Storm, serves as the founder and CEO of Arbiem, a community focused streaming platform available on the app store. In addition to his work as a musician, he studied computer science and built the platform as a solo project, developing the mobile app with React Native, along with the website and supporting infrastructure.
