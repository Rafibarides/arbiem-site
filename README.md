Brooklyn’s artistic DNA

The purpose of Arbiem Music is to unify and empower a collective of modern artists making music. Making music in apartments, studios, converted closets, and rented shul basements.

Some of us grew up on Golden Era hip hop, some on niggunim.
We’ve played open mics in Crown Heights, sung in choirs off Ocean Parkway, and bounced between sheva brachos and Rockwood Music Hall, all in the same week.

Arbiem is for the block. For the booth. For Brooklyn.
